### Hey, I'm Gustavo! Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

Keeping in touch with tech since [high school](https://foz.ifpr.edu.br/menu-de-cursos/tecnico-em-informatica/). My last academic achievement was a master's degree at [Unioeste](https://www5.unioeste.br/portalunioeste/pos/pgeec).

Currently working at [PTI](https://www.pti.org.br/) developing web applications mainly in Angular and Spring Boot. The projects I take part are usually related to electrical industry companies, such as [Itaipu](https://www.itaipu.gov.br/) and [Eletronuclear](https://www.eletronuclear.gov.br/).

As an enthusiast of stuff like automated tests and continuous integration/delivery, the facility of writing and testing Elixir code is fascinating me. Still taking my first steps, but already enjoying very much this little I learned so far.

Feel free to make contact! See ya! :v:
